    There are five special characters which must be replaced with an entity reference :
    &lt;	<	less than

    &apos;	'	apostrophe
    &quot;	"	quotation mark

<!-- 
    What's great about XML is we can add info to a preexisting file without breaking anything.
    For example, if we have a <to></to> <from></from> field and use it in an HTML form, we could add other fields
    and the HTML file could still find the info from the XML field.
    This is why we say it is an extensible language !

<!-- 
    Generally, it's prefered to use elements rather than attributes and to split up 
    elements as much as possible so as to ensure it's more easily expandable.
    Metadata should be stored as an element and stuff like an ID for internal use 
    could be used as an attribute.
-->

<!-- 
    So as to avoid element name conflicts, it's generally useful to use a prefix.
    For example, if we have a <table></table> with <tr></tr> and another with format
    stuff like <width></width>, etc.
    could use <h:table></h:table> and <f:table></f:table> for the names to ensure compatibility.
    In such a case, we have to define a namespace
    <f:table xmlns:f  = "url">
    
    </f:table>
    Not sure how that URL works though, more confusing
